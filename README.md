# Vanilla Tailwind

This is an experiment to build a functional subset of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [vanilla-extract](https://github.com/seek-oss/vanilla-extract). The default Tailwind Playground example was ported over to demonstrate how this works.

Note that this approach to using `vanilla-extract` is not ideal, and this experiment results in a fairly large CSS bundle size that should probably be avoided.
